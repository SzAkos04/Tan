# 6B - conditional sentences

## real and unreal conditionals

1. You **won't get** a phone upgrade unless you **have got** a contract.
   Can I borrow your laptop a moment if you **are not using** it?
   If it **stops** raining, I **am going to** walk into town.
2. How **would** you **know** if he **wasn't telling** the truth?
   If we **had** a bit more time here, we **could go** to the museum.
3. I **would have bought** that jacket if they **had had** it in my size.
   If you **had been looking** where you were going, you **might not have tripped**.

1. First conditional sentences are used to talk about a possible present or future situation and its result.
   We use any present tense in the if-clause and any form of the future or a modal verb in the other clause.
2. Second conditional sentences are used to talk about hypothetical or improbable situations in the present or future.
   We use the past tense (simple or continuous) in the if-clause and _would_ (or _could_ / _might_) + infinitive in the other clause.

### _was_ or _were_ in the if-clause?

We can use _were_ instead of _was_ after _I_ / _he_ / _she_ / _it_ in the if-clause and we always use were in the expression _If I were you..._

3. Third conditional sentences are used to talk about a hypothetical situation in the past.
   We use the past perfect (simple or continuous) in the if-clause and _would have_ (or _could_ / _might have_) + past participle in the other clause.

## mixed conditionals

I **wouldn't be** in this mess if I **had listened** to your advice.
If Jenny **didn't** still **love** Mike, she **would have left** him by now.

---

- If we want to refer to the present and the past in the same sentence, we can mix tenses from two different types of conditional, e.g. I wouldn't be in this mess (second conditional) if I had listened to your advice (third conditional). If Jenny didn't still love Mike (second conditional), she would have left him by now (third conditional).

## alternatives to _if_ in conditional sentences

1. I'll tell you what happened **as long as** / **so long as** you promise not to tell anyone else.
   **Provided** / **Providing** (**that**) the bank gives us a mortgage, we're going to buy that flat.
   My boss agreed to give me Friday off **on condition** (**that**) I worked over the weekend.
2. I'm going to sell the car **whether** you agree with me or not.
3. **Even if** I get the job, I'm going to carry on living with my parents for a while.
4. **Supposing** / **Suppose** you lost your phone, what would you do?
5. **Had I seen** the sign, I would have stopped.

1. We often use _as long as_ / _so long as_, _provided_ / _providing_ (_that_), and _on condition_ (_that_) instead of _if_ to emphasize what must happen or be done for something else to happen.
- _that_ is often omitted in spoken English. _on condition_ (_that_) is slightly more formal than the other expressions.
2. We can use _whether_ + subject + verb + _or not_ instead of _if_ to emphasize something is true in either of two cases.
- The word order can also be: I'm going to sell the car **whether or not** you agree with me.
3. We can use _even if_ instead of _if_ for extra emphasis.
4. We can use _supposing_ / _suppose_ when we ask someone to imagine that something is true or might happen. It is usually used at the beginning of a sentence.
5. In third conditionals, we can invert _had_ and the subject and leave out _if_. _Had I seen..._ = _If I had seen..._
