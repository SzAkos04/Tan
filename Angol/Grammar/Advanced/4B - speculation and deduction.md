1. As well as using _must_ for obligation, we also use _must_ + infinitive to say that we are almost sure something is true about the present and _must have_ + past participle to say that we are almost sure something was true or happened in the past.
2. We use _can't_ + infinitive to say that we are almost sure that something isn't true in the present and _can't have_ / _couldn't have_ + past participle to say that we are almost sure that something wasn't true / didn't happen in the past.
- We don't use _mustn't_ / _mustn't have_ with this meaning.
3. We use _may_ / _might_ / _could_ + infinitive and _may have_ / _might have_ / _could have_ + past participle to say that we think it's possible that something is true in the present, or it was true / happened in the past.
- We only use _may not_ or _might not_ to talk about a negative possibility. **NOT** ~~couldn't~~
4. We use _should_ / _ought to_ + infinitive to describe a situation we expect to happen. We use _should have_ / _ought to have_ + past participle to describe a situation we would expect to have happened in the past.

### Infinitive or continuous infinitive after modals?

He **must work** really hard. He never gets home before 9.00 p.m. (= deduction about a habitual action)
There's a light on in his office. He **must** still **be working**. (= deduction about an action in progress at the moment of speaking)

1. _bound_ and _sure_ are adjectives. We use _be bound_ or _be sure_ + _to_ + infinitive to say that we think something is certain to be true or to happen.
2. _likely_ and _unlikely_ are also adjectives (not adverbs). We can use subject + _be likely_ / _unlikely_ + _to_ + infinitive, or _it is likely_ / _unlikely_ + _that_ + clause.
3. _definitely_ and _probably_ are adverbs. They go before a main verb and after the auxiliary if there is one in [+] sentences and before the auxiliary in [-] sentences.
- With _be_ they go after the verb in [+] sentences and before the verb in [-] sentences, e.g. He's probably British. The painting definitely isn't genuine.
