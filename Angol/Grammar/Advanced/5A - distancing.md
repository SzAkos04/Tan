1. We often use _seem_ and _appear_ to give information without stating that we definitely know it is true, in this way distancing ourselves from the information.
   We can use _It seems_ / _appears_ + _that_ + clause, or subject + _seem_ / _appear_ + infinitive.
2. We use _It would seem_ / _appear_ + _that_ + clause to distance ourselves even further from the information, making it sound even less sure. This is more formal than _It seems_ / _appears..._
