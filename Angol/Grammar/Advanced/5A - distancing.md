# 5A - distancing

## _seem_ / _appear_

1. **It seems** / **appears that** when older people stay busy, they are in fact much healthier.
   The new Head of Department **seems** / **appears to be** quite friendly.
   Excuse me. **There seems** / **appears to be** a mistake with the bill.
2. **It would seem** / **appear that** Mr Young had been using the company's assets to pay off his private debts.

1. We often use _seem_ and _appear_ to give information without stating that we definitely know it is true, in this way distancing ourselves from the information.
   We can use _It seems_ / _appears_ + _that_ + clause, or subject + _seem_ / _appear_ + infinitive.
2. We use _It would seem_ / _appear_ + _that_ + clause to distance ourselves even further from the information, making it sound even less sure. This is more formal than _It seems_ / _appears..._

## the passive with verb of saying and reporting

1. **It is said that** using a washing machine saves people on average 47 minutes a day.
   **It has been announced by** a spokesperson **that** the President has been taken to hospital.
2. The company director **is expected to resign** in the next few days.
   The missing couple **are understood to have been living** in Panama for the last five years.
3. There **are thought to be** over a thousand species in danger of extinction.

- Another way of distancing ourselves from the facts, especially in formal written English, is to use the passive form of verbs like _say_, _think_, etc. to introduce them. We can use:
1. _It_ + passive verb + _that_ + clause.
- Verbs commonly used in this pattern are: _agree_, _announce_, _believe_, _claim_, _expect_, _hope_, _say_, _suggest_, and _think_.
2. subject + passive verb + _to_ + infinitive.
- Verbs commonly used in this pattern are: _believe_, _consider_, _expect_, _report_, _say_, _think_, and _understand_.
3. _There_ can also be used + passive verb + _to_ + infinitive. Compare:
- **It is said that there are** more than five million people living in poverty in this country.
- **There are said to be** more than five million people living in poverty in this country.

## other distancing expressions: _apparently_, _according to_, _may_ / _might_, _claim_

1. We use _apparently_ (usually either at the beginning or the end of a phrase) to mean that we have heard / read something, but that it may not be true. This is very common in informal conversation.
2. We use _according to_ to specify where information has come from. We use it to attribute opinions to somebody else. **NOT** ~~According to me...~~
3. Using _may_ / _might_ also suggests that something is a possibility, but not necessarily true.
4. We can say that somebody _claims_ something when there is some doubt about whether it is true.
