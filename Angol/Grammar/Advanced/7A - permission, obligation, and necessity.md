1. **Can** I use your phone, as my batter seems to have died?
   I **couldn't** take any photos in the gallery, so I bought some postcards.
   If you want to apply for this job, you **must** be able to speak Spanish.

1. The most common modal verbs for talking about permission and obligation are _can_ / _could_, _must_, and _should_ / _ought to_
- We can also use _May I...?_ to ask for permission, e.g. May I use your phone?
2. We can use _should have_ or _ought to have_ + past participle to talk about past events which did not happen which we regret.
3. _had better_ is stronger and more urgent than _should_ / _ought to_ and is more often used to give strong advice or a warning. It normally refers to the immediate future.
- The negative is _had better not_ **NOT** ~~hadn't better~~

## _mustn't_ / _don't have to_

You **mustn't** take photos during the performance.
You **don't have to** tip here unless you think the service was especially good.

---

- _mustn't_ and _don't have to_ are completely different.
	- _mustn't_ is used to express an obligation not to do something.
	- _don't_ / _doesn't have to_ is used to express an absence of obligation.
See [[1A - have|A1]] for information about _have to_ and _have got to_ to express obligation.

## _need_

1. You usually **need to** check in at least two hours before a flight leaves.
   You **don't need to** take a jacket. It's going to be hot today.
2. We **needn't** lock the car. Nobody will steal it in this village.
3. We **needn't have booked** / **didn't need to book**. The restaurant is empty!
4. We knew the way, so we **didn't need to use** the satnav.

1. We use _need_ / _don't need_ + _to_ + infinitive to say that something is necessary / unnecessary. You can use these forms for habitual, general, and specific necessity.
2. When we want to say that something is unnecessary on a specific occasion, we can also use _needn't_ + infinitive without _to_.
3. When something was not necessary, but you did it, you can use either _needn't have_ + past participle or _didn't need to_ + infinitive.
4. When something was not necessary, so you did not do it, you must use _didn't need to_. Compare:
   We didn't need to book. (= It wasn't necessary. We may have book or we may not.)
   We needn't have booked. (= We booked, but it wasn't necessary.)

## _be able to_, _be allowed to_, _be permitted to_, _be supposed_ / _meant to_

1. From tomorrow we **won't be able to** park in this street.
   You **are not allowed** / **permitted to** smoke in any public buildings in our country.
2. It **is not permitted to** take phones into the exam room.
3. We **are supposed** / **meant to** check out by 12.00. What's the time now?
   You **aren't supposed** / **meant to** park here - it's reserved for teachers.

1. We often use person + _be able to_ or _be allowed to_ + infinitive instead of _can_ to talk about what is possible or permitted.
2. _it_ + _be permitted to_ + infinitive is used in formal situations, e.g. notices and announcements, to say what can / can't be done according to the law or to rules and regulations.
- We don't use _it isn't allowed to..._ **NOT** ~~It isn't allowed to take phones into the exam room.~~
1. We can also use _be supposed to_ / _be meant to_ + infinitive to say what people should or shouldn't do, often because of rules. There is often a suggestion that the rules are not necessarily obeyed, e.g. Students are not supposed / meant to have guests after 12.00, but everyone does.
