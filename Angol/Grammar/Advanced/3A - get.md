- _get_ is one of the most common verbs in English and can be used in many different ways.
1. _get_ + noun / pronoun usually means 'receive', 'bring', 'fetch', 'obtain', 'buy', or 'catch'; with _to_ + a place it means 'arrive at / in'.
2. We use _get_ + adjective or comparative adjective to mean 'become'.
- Compare _be_ + adjective and _get_ + adjective:
  It's dark. It's getting dark.
  I'm not used to the climate in England now. I'm getting used to the climate in England.
3. We can use _get_ + past participle instead of _be_ to make a passive structure. This is more informal than using _be_ and is more often used to talk about bad or unexpected things that have happened.
4. In informal spoken English, we sometimes use _get_ + object + past participle instead of _have_ + object + past participle to say that you ask or pay another person to do something for you.

5. We can use _get_ + object + infinitive with _to_ to mean 'make', 'tell', 'persuade' somebody (to) do something.
- _have_ can also be used in this way (without to), especially in American English, e.g. I'll have someone send you the details.
