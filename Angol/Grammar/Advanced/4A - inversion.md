- In formal English, especially in writing, we sometimes change the normal word order to make the sentence more emphatic or dramatic.
1. This structure is common with negative adverbial expressions such as _Not only..._, _Not until..._, _Never (again)..._, and _No sooner..._ (= a formal way of saying _as soon as_).
- When we use inversion after the above expressions, we change the order of the subject and (auxiliary) verb. **NOT** ~~Not only the plot is great,...~~
  Compare:
  I have never heard such a ridiculous argument. (= normal word order)
  Never have I heard such a ridiculous argument. (= inversion to make the sentence more emphatic)
1. In the present simple and past simple tense, rather than simply inverting the subject and verb, we use _do_ / _does_ / _did_ + subject + main verb. **NOT** ~~Not only forgot you to shut the window...~~
2. Inversion is also used after the expressions _Only then..._, _Only when..._, _Hardly_ / _Scarcely..._, _Rarely..._

### Overuse of inversion

Inversion should only be used occasionally for dramatic effect. Overusing it will make your English sound unnatural.
