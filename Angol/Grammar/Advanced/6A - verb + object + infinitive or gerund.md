# 6A - verb + object + infinitive or gerund

## verb + object + _to_ + infinitive

1. She **advised him not to travel** by train.
   We **expect the flight to arrive** at 19.50.
   It **took us ages to get** there.
2. I **am waiting for my friend to arrive**.
   We **have arranged for a taxi to come** at 6.30.
3. I **want Arsenal to win**.
   I **would hate you to think** that I don't appreciate your offer of help.
   I **would like you to send** me the bill.

1. We often use the following verbs + object + (_not_) _to_ + infinitive: _advise_, _allow_, _ask_, _beg_, _cause_, _enable_, _encourage_, _expect_, _force_, _help_, _intend_, _invite_, _mean_, _order_, _persuade_, _remind_, _take_ (time), _teach_, _tell_, _warn_.
- After _advise_, _persuade_, _remind_, _teach_, _tell_, and _warn_ you can also use an object + _that_ clause, e.g. She advised him that he shouldn't travel by train.

### Other patterns

After _advise_, _allow_, _encourage_, or _recommend_, if we want to use another verb, but without an object, a gerund is needed, e.g. We don't allow eating and drinking on the premises. I recommend visiting the castle.
After _recommend_ we can also use a _that_ clause, e.g. He recommended that I took some cash.

2. After some verbs including _arrange_, _ask_, _plan_, and _wait_ we put _for_ immediately after the verb before the object + _to_ + infinitive.
3. We also often use verb + object + _to_ + infinitive with _want_, _would like_, _would love_, _would prefer_, and _would hate_.
- After all these verbs a _that_ clause is impossible. **NOT** ~~I want that Arsenal wins. I would hate that you think...~~

- We can use object + infinitive without _to_ after _let_, _make_, and _help_.
- _help_ can be followed by an object + infinitive with or without _to_, e.g. She helped me (to) make the dinner.

### Passive form of _make sb do sth_

When _make sb do sth_ is used in the passive, it is followed by the infinitive with _to_ e.g. We were made to clean our rooms every morning.
