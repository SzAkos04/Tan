- We use _who_, _which_, _whose_, _whom_, and _what_ to introduce a defining relative clause, i.e. a clause which gives essential information about somebody or something.
1. We can use _that_ instead of _who_ / _which_. This is very common in conversation.
2. We use _whose_ to mean 'of who' or 'of which'.
3. When _who_ or _which_ are the object of the verb in the relative clause, you can leave them out.
4. In formal English, after a preposition, use _whom_ for a person and _which_ for a thing. In formal English it is more common to leave out the relative pronoun and put the preposition after the verb.
5. We use _what_ as a relative pronoun to mean 'the thing' or 'things which'.

   Buckingham Palace, **which was built in the 18th century**, is visited by thousands of tourists.
2. Adriana hasn't come to class for two weeks, **which is a bit worrying**.
3. They've got three children, **all of whom** are good at sport.
   My favourite foods are bread, biscuits, and cakes, **none of which** are very good for me.
   A lot of parents, **many of whose** children go to the local school, are protesting today about plans for the new road.

1. A non-defining relative clause gives extra, non essential information about a person or thing.
- In written English, this kind of clause is separated by commas, or between a comma and a full stop.
- You can't use _that_ instead of _who_ / _which_. **NOT** ~~My brother, that doesn't like sport,...~~
2. _which_ can be used to refer to the whole of the preceding clause.
3. We sometimes use _of which_ / _of whom_ / _of whose_ after _some_, _any_, _none_, _all_, _both_, _either_, _neither_, _several_, _enough_, _many_, and _few_.
- We can also use _of which_ / _of whom_ / _of whose_ after expressions of quantity and superlatives.
