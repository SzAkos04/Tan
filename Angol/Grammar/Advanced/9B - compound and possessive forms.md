# 9B - nouns: compound and possessive forms

## apostrophe _s_

   I borrowed **Chris's** car.
   It's my **friends'** wedding.
   That's the **children's** room.
2. The blonde girl is **Alex and Maria's** daughter.
3. We had dinner at **Tom's** last night.
   My mother is at the **hairdresser's**.

- Possessive forms express the idea of 'having' (in a very general sense) which exists between two nouns.
1. We normally use a possessive noun (+ _'s_) when something belongs to or is a characteristic of a particular person (people) or thing (things).
2. If there are two people, we put the _'s_ on the second name.
- If we are referring to things belonging to two separate people, we put the _'s_ on both names, e.g. John's and Kay's tastes in food are completely different.
3. When _'s_ refers to premises, e.g. 'the house of' or 'the shop of', we often omit, e.g. house or shop.
4. We often use _'s_ or _s'_ with time expressions, e.g. yesterday's news, an hour's journey.

## using _of_ (instead of apostrophe _s_)

1. Can you remember the name **of** the film?
   My brother lives at the end **of** the road.
   The problems **of** old age are many and varied.
2. Helen is the sister **of** my cousin in Rome I told you about.
3. Jack is a friend **of** my brother's.

1. We normally use an _of_ phrase, not _'s_, with things or abstract nouns.
2. We tend to use _of_ and not _'s_ to express possession with a long phrase, e.g. **NOT** ~~my cousin in Rome I told you about's sister.~~
3. With friend, colleague, etc. we often say, e.g. _a friend of_ + name / noun + _'s_ (= one of my brother's friends)
- We also often use a possessive pronoun after _a friend of..._, e.g. a friend of mine / hers.

## compound nouns

1. I need the **tin opener**. Do you know where it is?
   I bought a huge **plant pot** in a **garden centre** near my house.
   My brother is a **company director** and my sister is a **history teacher**.
   I opened the **car door**, got in, and put on my **seat belt**.
2. I bought my son a new **story book**.
   What does that **road sign** mean?
3. There was a **bottle of wine** on the table and two **wine glasses**.

1. We use compound nouns to express many common ideas in English. The first noun modifies or describes the second noun. _tin opener_ = an opener for tins, _history teacher_ = a teacher of history. The first noun is usually singular, unless it has no singular form, e.g. _clothes_, but the second noun can be singular or plural.

### One word, two words, or hyphenated?

Compound nouns are usually two separate words, but they are sometimes joined together as one word, e.g. _sunglasses_, _bathroom_, or occasionally hyphenated, e.g. _role-play_.

2. We use compound nouns to describe a common class of object or person. Compare:
- a _story book_ **BUT** a book about house decoration
- a _road sign_ **BUT** a sign of the times
2. With containers, a compound noun (e.g. _a wine bottle_) focuses on the container (usually empty), whereas the container + possessive noun (_a bottle of wine_) focuses on the contents.
- Other common examples are a _wine glass_ / _a glass of wine_, a _jam jar_ / _a jar of jam_, a _petrol can_ / _a can of petrol_, a _coffee cup_ / _a cup of coffee_, etc.
