1. We often leave out a repeated verb phrase or adjective and just repeat the auxiliary or modal verb, or the verb _be_, e.g. Laura has never been to the States, but her sister has ~~been there~~.
- If the verb we don't want to repeat is the present or past simple, we use _do_ / _does_ / _did_ in the ellipsis.
2. We can use a different auxiliary or modal verb from that used in the first part of the sentence.
3. We can also leave out a repeated verb phrase after the infinitive with _to_. This is called a reduced infinitive, e.g. I've never ridden a motorbike, but I'd love to ~~ride one~~.

1. With positive clauses, we often use _so_ instead of repeating a whole [+] clause after verbs of thinking (_assume_, _believe_, _expect_, _guess_, _hope_, _imagine_, _presume_, _reckon_, _suppose_, _think_) and also after _be afraid_, _appear_ / _seem_, and _say_.
- _I hope so._ = I hope I'll have finished the work by Friday.
2. With negative clauses, we can use a [+] verb + _not_ or a [-] verb + _so_.
- We normally use a [+] verb + _not_ with _be afraid_, _assume_, _guess_, _hope_, _presume_, and _suspect_, e.g. I hope not.
- We normally use a [-] verb + _so_ with _think_, e.g. I don't think so.
- With other verbs (_appear_, _believe_, _expect_, _imagine_, _seem_, and _suppose_) we can use either form, e.g.
  **A** It's very late. I don't think they'll come now, do you?
  **B** No, I **imagine not**. / I **don't imagine so**.
