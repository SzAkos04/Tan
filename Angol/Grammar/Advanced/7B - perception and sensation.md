# 7B - perception and sensation

## _see_, _hear_, _smell_, _feel_, _taste_

**Can** you **see** that tiny figure at the top of the painting?
I **can hear** a weird beeping noise coming from the kitchen.
I **can smell** burning. Are you sure you turned the gas off?
I **can feel** a draught - is there a window open?
I **can't taste** the garlic in the soup.

- The five basic verbs of the senses, _see_, _hear_, _smell_, _feel_, and _taste_ are stative (non-action) verbs and are not normally used in the continuous form.
- We normally use _can_ with these verbs to refer to something happening at the moment, instead of the present continuous, e.g. I can smell burning. **NOT** ~~I'm smelling burning.~~

## _see_ / _hear_ / _watch_ / _feel_ + infinitive or gerund

1. I **saw** a man **hit** his dog really aggressively.
   I think I **heard** the alarm **go off**.
2. I **saw** the man **hitting** his dog really aggressively.
   I think I **heard** the alarm **going off**.
3. I **watched** a street artist **draw** / **drawing** a caricature.
   I **felt** someone **touch** / **touching** my shoulder.

1. We often use _see_ / _hear_ + object + verb in the infinitive. This means you saw or heard the whole action.
2. We can also use _see_ / _hear_ + object + gerund. In this case the meaning is slightly different, meaning you saw / heard an action in progress or a repeated action.
3. The distinction above also applies to verbs after _watch_, _feel_, _notice_, and _listen_

## _look_, _feel_, _smell_, _sound_, _taste_

1. That sofa **looks** really uncomfortable.
   Does that noise **sound like** thunder to you?
   It smells **as if** / **as though** someone has been making a curry.
2. **A** I love your new perfume. It **smells of** orange blossom.
   **B** Yes, I love it too. In fact it **smells** a bit **like** yours.
   This sauce **tastes of** flour. I don't think you've cooked it for long enough.
   This sauce **tastes like** one my mother used to make.

- When we talk about the impression something or someone gives us through the senses, we use _look_, _feel_, _smell_, _sound_, and _taste_ followed by an adjective, _like_ + noun or _as if_ / _as though_ + clause.
- Nowadays _like_ is often used as an alternative to _as if_ / _as though_ e.g. It looks like it's going to rain.
2. Compare _smell_ / _taste of_ and _smell_ / _taste like_:
   It smells / tastes **of**... (= it has that smell / taste)
   It tastes / smells **like**... (= it has a similar smell / taste)

## _seem_

1. You **seem** worried. Is something wrong?
   It **seemed like** a good idea at the time, but in fact it wasn't.
   It **seems as if** / **as though** every time I clean the car it rains.
2. You **seem to be** a bit down today. Are you OK?
   The waiter **seems to have made** a mistake with the bill.
   The couple next door **seem to be arguing** a lot more than they used to.

1. We can use _seem_ followed by an adjective, _like_ + noun or _as if_ / _as though_ + clause. Compare:
   You seem worried. (= I get this impression from the way you are behaving in general - voice actions, etc.)
   You look worried. (= I get this impression from your face.)
2. We can also use _seem_ + an infinitive (simple, perfect, or continuous).
