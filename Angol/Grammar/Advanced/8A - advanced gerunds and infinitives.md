1. We use a passive gerund (_being done_) or a passive infinitive (_to be done_) to describe actions which are done to the subject.
2. We use a perfect gerund (_having done_) or a perfect infinitive (_to have done_) if we want to emphasize that an action is completed or in the past.
- Often there is no difference between using a simple gerund or infinitive and a perfect gerund or infinitive, e.g.
  He denied stealing / having stolen the money.
  It was our fault. We were silly not to lock / not to have locked the car.
3. We use the perfect infinitive after _would like_, _would love_, _would hate_, _would prefer_, and _would rather_ to talk about an earlier action. Compare:
   I would like to see the Eiffel Tower. (= when I go to Paris in the future)
   I would like to have seen the Eiffel Tower. (= I was in Paris, but I didn't see it)
4. We use a continuous infinitive (_to be_ + verb + _-ing_) to say that an action / event is in progress around the time we are talking about.

1. We use the gerund after certain expressions with _it_ or _there_, e.g. _It's no use_, _There's no point_, _It's no good_, etc.
We use the infinitive with _to_:
2. after nouns formed from verbs which take the infinitive, e.g. _agree_, _plan_, _hope_, etc.
3. after expressions with quantifiers, e.g. _enough_, _too much_, _a lot_, _plenty of_, etc.
When we want to refer to the subject of the infinitive verb we use _for_ + person or object pronoun before the infinitive. This can be used before any infinitive structure, e.g. after adjectives: It's very difficult **for me to decide**.
4. after something, anywhere, etc.
5. after question words (except _why_).
6. after superlatives and _first_, _second_, _last_, etc., e.g. Who was the first person to walk on the moon?

### _and_ + verb

We often use _and_ + verb instead of _to_ + infinitive after _try_, _wait_, _come_, and _go_, e.g. Come and see me when you're next in New York.
I'm not sure what's going to happen - we need to wait and see.
