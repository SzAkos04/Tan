## present and future forms

1. The present continuous is the most common way to talk about arrangements, i.e. fixed plans of the future, when the time and place have been decided.
2. _be going to_ is the most common way to express future plans and intentions and to imply that a decision has been made.
- When we talk about the future from a point of view of a time in the past, we use _was_ / _were going to_, e.g. We were a bit worried about what the weather **was going to be** like.

### _be going to_ or the present continuous?

In most cases we can use either _be going to_ or the present continuous without much difference in meaning. However, the present continuous emphasizes that a time and place to do something has been decided, while _be going to_ emphasizes the intention. Compare:
I'm seeing Sarah tomorrow. (= it's our arrangement)
I'm going to give her a birthday present. (= it's my intention)
We do not use the present continuous when it is clear that something is only an intention, but no arrangements have been made, e.g. I'm going to talk to Mike about it when I next see him. **NOT** ~~I'm talking to Mike about it...~~

3. The future continuous can often be used instead of the present continuous to refer to future arrangements.
- We sometimes use the future continuous to emphasize that we are talking about something that will happen anyway rather than something we have arranged. Compare:
  I'm seeing Sarah tomorrow. (= I have arranged it)
  I'll be seeing Sarah at the party tomorrow. (= it will happen anyway, but I didn't arrange it)
- It is often used to make polite enquiries about arrangements, e.g. Will you be meeting us at the airport?
- We also use the future continuous to say that an action will be in progress at a certain time in the future.
4. We can use the present simple to talk about future events which are part of a timetable or a regular schedule.

1. _be due to_ + infinitive can be used to say that something is arranged or expected at a certain time. This is a more formal style.
- We also use _due_ on its own to mean 'expected', e.g. The next train is due in five minutes.
2. We use _be about to_ + infinitive to say that something is going to happen very soon, but without giving a specific time.
- We can also use _be on the point of_ + gerund with a similar meaning, but this is slightly more formal and implies something is more imminent, e.g. It is believed that the Chancellor is on the point of resigning.
3. We can use _be_ + _to_ + infinitive in a formal style to talk about official plans and arrangements.
