## result

1. I have a job interview next week, **so** I've bought myself a suit!
2. It had snowed hard all night. **As a result**, the airport was closed until 11.00 a.m.
   We regret that you do not have the necessary qualifications and **therefore** / **consequently** we are unable to offer you the job.

1. _so_ is the most common way of introducing a result or a logical connection.
2. _as a result_, _therefore_, and _consequently_ (more formal than _so_) are often used at the beginning of a sentence or clause.
- _therefore_ and _consequently_ can also be used before a main verb, e.g. We have therefore / consequently decided not to offer you the job.

## reason

1. I've stopped emailing her, **because** / **as** / **since** she never answers me.
   Can I go home, **seeing as** / **seeing that** there's no work to do?
2. The plane was late **because of** the fog.
   Flight 341 has been delayed **due to** / **owing to** adverse weather conditions.

1. _because_, _as_, and _since_ (more formal) are synonyms and are used to introduce clauses giving a reason. _as_ and _since_ are often used at the beginning of a sentence, e.g. As / Since the rain hasn't stopped, we've decided not to go out.
- We can use _seeing as_ / _that_ to give a reason for what we're saying.
2. _because of_, _due to_, and _owing to_ also express the reason for something. They are usually followed by a noun, a gerund or _the fact that_ + clause.
- _due to_ and _owing to_ are more formal than _because of_.

## purpose

1. I did a language course **to** / **in order to** / **so as to** improve my English.
2. He closed the door quietly **so as not to** / **in order not to** wake the baby.
3. They moved to London **so** (**that**) they could see their grandchildren more often.
4. I'm not going te tell Amy, **in case** she tells everyone else.

1. _to_, _in order to_, and _so as to_ introduce a clause of purpose and are all followed by an infinitive. _to_ is the most informal.
2. For negative purpose we use _so as not to_ or _in order not to_.
3. We can also use _so_ (_that_) + _can_ / _could_ + verb or _will_ / _would_ + verb to express purpose. _that_ can be left out in informal English.
- Use _so_ (_that_) when there is a change of subject in the clause of purpose, e.g. She put a blanket over the baby so (that) he wouldn't be cold.
4. We use _in case_ + a clause when we do something in order to be ready for future situations / problems, or to avoid them.

## contrast

1. The meeting was OK, **but** the journey home was a nightmare.

   It's a really good idea. **However**, it may be too expensive.
   The moon shone brightly. **Nevertheless**, it was hard to find our way.
2. We enjoyed the film **although** / **even though** / **though** it was long.
3. **In spite of** / **Despite** being 85, she still travels all over the world.
   **In spite of** / **Despite** her age...
   **In spite of** / **Despite** the fact that she's 85...

1. _but_ is the most common and informal way of introducing contrast and is normally used to link two contrasting points within a sentence. _yet_ is used in the same way, but is more formal / literary.
- _however_ and _nevertheless_ are normally used at the beginning of a sentence to connect it to the previous one and are usually followed by a comma.
- _nevertheless_ (or _nonetheless_) is more formal / literary than _however_.
2. _even though_ is more emphatic than _although_. _though_ is more common in informal speech.
3. After _in spite of_ and _despite_, use a gerund, a noun, or _the fact that_ + clause.
