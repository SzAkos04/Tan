- When we want to focus attention on or emphasize one part of a sentence, we can do this by adding certain words or phrases to the beginning of the sentence. This is sometimes called a 'cleft sentence'.
1. We can make some kinds of sentences more emphatic by beginning with _What_ (= the thing) or _All_ (= the only thing) + clause + _be_ and then the part of the sentence we want to emphasize.
2. To emphasize an event or sequence of events, we can begin with _What happens is_ (_that_)_..._ / _What happened was_ (_that_)_..._
3. We can make part of a sentence more emphatic by beginning with an expression like _The person who_, _The thing which_, _The place where_, _The first_ / _last time_, _The reason why_, etc. + clause + _be_, with the emphasized part of the sentence at the end.
4. We can also use _It is_ / _was_ + the emphasized part of the sentence + a relative clause.

### _It was me who..._ or _It was I who..._?

In informal spoken English, if the emphasized part is a pronoun, we normally use the object pronoun after _It is_ / _was_, e.g. I paid the bill. - It was me who paid the bill.
Compare: It was I who paid the bill. (= very formal)
