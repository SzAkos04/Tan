# 5B - unreal uses of past tenses

1. It's so expensive! I **wish** I **could** afford it!
   I **wish** (that) you **hadn't spoken** to Julie like that - you know how sensitive she is.
2. **If only** he **were** a bit less stubborn! Then we wouldn't have so many arguments.
   **If only** you **hadn't forgotten** the map, we'd be there by now.
3. I **wish** she **were** a bit more generous.
   **If only** the weather **were** a bit warmer, we could walk there.
4. **I'd rather** you **left** your dog outside - I'm allergic to animals.
   Are you sure this is a good time to talk? **Would you rather** I **called** back later?
5. Don't you think **it's time** you **found** a job? It's six months since you finished university!

1. We use _wish_ + past simple to talk about things we would like to be different in the present / future (but which are impossible or unlikely).
   We use _wish_ + past perfect to talk about things which happened / didn't happen in the past and which we now regret.
- We sometimes use _that_ after _wish_.
2. We sometimes use _If only..._ instead of _I wish..._ It is less common and more emphatic. It can be used by itself, e.g. If only I hadn't said it! but it can also be used with another clause, e.g. If only I hadn't said it, none of this would have happened!
- When we want to talk about things we want to happen or stop happening because they annoy us, we use _wish_ or _If only_ + person / thing + _would_ + infinitive, e.g. I wish the bust would come! If only he wouldn't keep whistling when I'm working!
3. We can use _were_ instead of _was_ for _I_ / _he_ / _she_ / _it_ after _wish_ and _if only_.
4. We use _would rather_ + subject + past tense to express a preference.
- We can also use _would rather_ + infinitive without _to_ when there is no change of subject, e.g. **I**'d rather **not talk** about it. However we cannot use this structure when the subject changes after _would rather_, e.g. **I**'d rather **you didn't talk** about it. **NOT** ~~I'd rather you not talk about it.~~
5. We use the past simple after _It's_ (_high_) _time_ + subject to say that something has to be done now or in the near future.
- We can also use _It's time_ + _to_ + infinitive when we don't want to specify the subject, e.g. It's time to go now.
