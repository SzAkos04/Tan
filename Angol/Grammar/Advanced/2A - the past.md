# 2A - the past: habitual events and specific incidents

## narrative tenses: describing specific incidents in the past

This **happened** when I **was** about five years old. My father **had gone away** on business for a few days and my brother and I **were sleeping** in my parents' bedroom. Before we **went** to bed that night, I **had been reading** a very scary story about a wicked witch. In the middle of the night, I **woke up** with a start and **was** that a figure in a dark coat **was standing** in the doorway. I **screamed** at the top of my voice.

When we describe specific incidents in the past, we use **narrative tenses**, i.e. the past simple, past continuous, and past perfect simple or continuous.
- We use the past simple to talk about the main actions in a story (We went to bed..., I woke up..., I screamed).
- We use the past continuous to set the scene (We were sleeping in my parents' bedroom) and to describe actions in progress in the past (Somebody was standing in the doorway).
- We use the past perfect and the past perfect continuous to talk about the earlier past, i.e. things which happened before the main event (My father had gone away..., I had been reading a story).

## _used to_ and _would_: describing habitual events and repeated actions in the past

1. Every summer, my family **used to rent** an old house in the south of France. My sister and I **often walked** to the harbour in the morning, where we **used to watch** the fishermen cleaning their nets.
2. Every night before we went to bed, my mother **would tell** us stories, but she **would never read** them from a book - she **would always make them up** herself.
3. When I was a teenager, my friends **were always teasing** me because of my red hair.

1. We often use _used to_ + infinitive as an alternative to the past simple to talk about things that we did repeatedly in the past.
- We can also use _used to_ + infinitive to talk about situations or states which have changed, e.g. I used to have much longer hair when I was younger.
2. We use _would_ + infinitive as an alternative to _used to_ to talk about things that we did repeatedly in the past over a period of time.
- We don't use _would_ with stative verbs, i.e. to talk about situations or states which have changed. **NOT** ~~I would have much longer hair when I was younger.~~
- We don't use _would_ without a time reference, e.g. I used to play the violin. **NOT** ~~I would play the violin~~
3. We can also use _always_ + past continuous for things that happened repeatedly, especially when they were irritating habits.

### _used to_ and _be_ / _get used to_

Be careful not to confuse _used to_ and _be_ / _get used to_. _used to_ only describes states or repeated actions in the past, _be_ / _get used to_ means be / get familiar with, e.g. **We used to live** in London. We moved to the country last year, but **we're still not used to it**. It's too quiet for me, and **my husband can't get used to** having to drive everywhere.
