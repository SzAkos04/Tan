# 2B - pronouns

## generic pronouns

1. We often use _you_ to mean people in general.
2. We can also use _one_ + third person singular of the verb to mean people in general. _one_ is much more formal than _you_ and is very rarely used in spoken English.
- We can also use _one's_ as a possessive adjective, e.g. When confronted with danger, one's first reaction is often to freeze.
3. _we_ can also be used to make a general statement of opinion which includes the reader / listener.
4. In informal English, we often use _they_ to talk about other people in general, or people in authority, e.g. **They** always say... (They = people in general); **They** should make it compulsory... (They = the government).
5. We use _they_, _them_, and _their_ to refer to one person who may be male or female, instead of using _he_ or _she_, _his_ or _her_, etc.

3. We decorated the house **ourselves**.
   There's no way I'm going to do it for you. Do it **yourself**!
4. I don't feel very comfortable going to the cinema **by myself**.

1. We often use reflexive pronouns when the subject and object of a verb are the same person.
- We don't usually use reflexive pronouns with some verbs which may be reflexive in other languages, e.g. wash, shave, etc. **NOT** ~~He got up, shaved himself, and...~~
- _enjoy_ is always used with a reflexive pronoun when not followed by another object, e.g. Enjoy your meal! **BUT** Did you enjoy **yourself** last night?
2. We can also use reflexive pronouns after most prepositions when the complement is the same as the subject.
- After prepositions of place we use object pronouns, not reflexive pronouns, e.g. She put the bag next to her on the seat. **NOT** ~~next to herself~~
3. We can use reflexive pronouns to emphasize the subject, e.g. We decorated the house ourselves. (= we did it, not professional decorators).
4. _by_ + reflexive pronoun = alone, on your / her, etc. own.
5. We use _each other_ or _one another_ for reciprocal actions, i.e. A does the action to B, and B does the action to A.

1. We use _it_ + _be_ to talk about time, temperature, and distance
2. We also use _it_ + _be_ as a 'preparatory' subject before adjectives. It was great to hear from you. **NOT** ~~To hear from you was great.~~
3. We use _there_ + _be_ + noun to say if people and things are present or exist (or not). You cannot use _It..._ here . **NOT** ~~It used to be a cinema in that street~~
