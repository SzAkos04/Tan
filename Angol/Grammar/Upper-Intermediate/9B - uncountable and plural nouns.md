1. The following nouns are always uncountable:
   _accommodation_, _behaviour_, _health_, _politics_ (and other words ending in -ics, e.g. _athletics_, _economics_), _progress_, _rubbish_, _scenery_, _traffic_, _weather_, _work_.
- Uncountable nouns don't have a plural form, and they use a singular verb. **NOT** ~~The sceneries are beautiful here.~~
- Don't use _a_ / _an_ with uncountable nouns. **NOT** ~~There's a terrible traffic this evening.~~
2. These nouns are also uncountable: _advice_, _bread_, _equipment_, _furniture_, _homework_, _information_, _luck_, _luggage_, _news_, _research_, _toast_. With these, you can use _a piece of_ to talk about an individual item.
3. Some nouns can be either countable (C) or uncountable (U), but the meaning changes, e.g. _a glass_ (C) = the thing you drink out of; _glass_ (U) = the material used to make windows. Other examples: _business_, _iron_, _light_, _paper_, _space_, _time_.

1. _arms_ (= _guns_, etc.), _belongings_, _clothes_, _manners_, _outskirts_, _scissors_, and _trousers_ / _shorts_ are plural nouns with no singular. They need a plural verb, and they can't be used with _a_ / _an_.
- If the word refers to something with two parts, e.g. scissors, shorts, trousers, etc., it can be used with _a pair of_ or _some_.
2. _crew_, _family_, _government_, _police_, _staff_, _team_, etc. are collective nouns and refer to a group of people. We use them with singular verb when we are referring to the group, e.g. My family is very big, but they can also be used with a plural verb when we are thinking of the people as individuals, e.g. My family are all very talkative.
- _police_ is always used with a plural verb.
