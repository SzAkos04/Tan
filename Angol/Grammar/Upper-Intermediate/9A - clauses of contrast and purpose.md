- We use _although_, _though_, _even though_, and _in spite of_ or _despite_ to express a contrast.
1. _although_, _though_, and _even though_ are usually used at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence.
- _though_ is more formal than _although_.
- _even though_ is stronger than _although_ / _though_ and is used to express a big or surprising contrast.
- _though_ can also be used as an adverb, usually at the end of a sentence, after a comma. In this case, it means _however_.
1. After _in spite of_ or _despite_, we cane use a noun, a verb in the -ing form, or _the fact that_ + subject + verb.
- Remember not to use _of_ after _despite_. **NOT** ~~Despite of the rain,...~~

## clauses of purpose

- Use _to_, _in order to_, _so as to_, _for_, and _so that_ to express purpose.
1. After _to_, _in order to_, and _so as to_, use an infinitive.
- _in order to_ and _so as to_ are more formal than _to_.
2. Use _for_ + a noun, e.g. for a meeting.
- You can also use _for_ + gerund to describe the exact purpose of a thing, e.g. This liquid is for cleaning metal.
3. After _so that_, use a subject + modal verb (can, could, would, etc.).
- When there is a change of subject in a clause of purpose, we use _so that_, e.g. We bought a new car so that the children would have more space. **NOT** ~~to / in order to / so as to the children...~~ This is the only way of expressing purpose when there is a change of subject.
4. To express a negative purpose, use _as as not to_ or _in order not to_, e.g. I wrote down what he said in order not to forget it. **NOT** ~~..to not forget it.~~
