# 10B - articles

## basic rules: _a_ / _an_ / _the_, no article

1. My neighbour has just got **a** dog and **a** cat.
   **The** dog is **an** Alsatian and **the** cat is **a** Siamese.

1. Use _a_ or _an_ when you mention somebody or something for the first time or say who or what somebody or something is. Use _the_ when it's clear who or what somebody or something is (e.g. it has been mentioned before, or it's unique, i.e. the only one that exists or that you own).
2. Don't use an article to speak in general with plural and uncountable nouns.
3. Don't use an article in phrases like _at home_ / _work_, _go_ / _come home / to bed_, _next / last_ (_week_), etc.

## institutions

My father's **in hospital**.
They're building **a new hospital** in my town.
He was sent **to prison** for two years.
My grandmother used to work in **the prison** as a cleaner.

- With words like _prison_, _church_, _school_, _hospital_, and _university_, don't use an article when you are thinking about the institution and the normal purpose it is used for. If you are just thinking about the building, use _a_ or _the_.
