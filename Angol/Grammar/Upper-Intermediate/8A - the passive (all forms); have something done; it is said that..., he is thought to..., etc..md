# 8A - the passive (all forms); have something done; it is said that..., he is thought to..., etc.

## the passive (all forms)

1. We use the passive when we talk about an action but are not so interested in who or what does / did the action.
- To make the tense or form, we use the verb _be_ + past participle, e.g. Murderers are usually sentenced to life in prison. The prisoner will be released next month. The tense changes are shown by the verb _be_, e.g. _are_, _will be_, etc.
1. To mention the person or thing that did the action (the agent), we use _by_. However, in the majority of passive sentences, the agent is not mentioned.

## _have something done_ (causative have)

1. I **have** just **had** my bank account **hacked**.
   We **had** our passports **stolen** from our hotel room.
   **Have** you ever **had** your car **vandalized**?
2. We **have** just **had** a burglar alarm **installed**.

1. We can use _have something done_ to refer to something (usually bad) that is done to us.
- Remember, _have_ is the main verb, so it changes according to the tense. We use auxiliary verbs (_do_, _did_, etc.) to make questions and negatives.
1. This structure is also used to talk about something that we arrange (and usually pay) for someone to do for us, because we can't or don't want to do it ourselves.

- This formal structure is used especially in news reports with the verbs _know_, _tell_, _understand_, _report_, _expect_, _say_, _believe_, and _think_. It makes the information sound more impersonal.
1. We use _It is said_, _believed_, etc. + _that_ + clause.
2. We use _He_, _The man_, etc. (i.e. the subject of the clause) + _is said_, _believed_, etc. + _to_ + infinitive (e.g. to be) or perfect infinitive (e.g. to have been) when talking about the past.
