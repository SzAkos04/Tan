- We use _must_, _may_ / _might_ / _could_, or _can't_ / _couldn't_ + _have_ + past participle to make deductions or speculate about past actions.
1. We use _must have_ when we are almost sure that something happened or was true.
   The opposite of _must have_ is _can't have_ **NOT** ~~mustn't have~~ - see 3.
2. We use _might_ / _may_ / _could_ + _have_ when we think it's possible that something happened or was true.
- We can also use _may_ / _might not have_ (but **NOT** ~~couldn't have~~) to talk about the possibility that something didn't happen. **NOT** ~~I couldn't have given him the right directions.~~
1. We use _can't have_ and _couldn't have_ when we are almost sure something didn't happen or that it is impossible. We only use _couldn't have_ when the speculation is about the distant past, e.g. They couldn't have been married. They both died young.

## _should have_ / _ought to have_ + past participle

We've gone the wrong way. We **should have turned** left at the traffic lights.
It's my fault. I **ought to have told** you earlier that my party was on Saturday.

- We use _should_ / _shouldn't_ + _have_ + past participle to say that somebody didn't do the right thing, or to express regret or criticism.
- We can use _ought_ / _oughtn't to have_ as an alternative to _should_ / _shouldn't have_, e.g. I ought to have told you earlier.
- _must have_ and _should have_ have completely different meanings. Compare:
  She should have phoned me. = I told her to phone me but she didn't
  and
  She must have phoned me. = I'm sure she phoned me. I think that missed call was her number.
