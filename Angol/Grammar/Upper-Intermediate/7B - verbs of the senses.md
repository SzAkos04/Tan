1. We use _look_, _feel_, etc. + adjective.
2. We use _look_, _feel_, etc. + _like_ + noun (phrase).
3. We use _look_, _feel_, etc. + _as if_ + clause.
- You cane use _...like_ or _...as though_ instead of _...as if_, e.g. It sounds like / as though it's raining.
4. We use _look_ to describe the specific impression we get from someone's appearance. We use _seem_ to describe a general impression we get (not necessarily appearance).
- _seem_ can be followed by the same structures as _look_, e.g. Mark seems like a nice man.

### _feel like_

_feel like_ can also be used as a verb meaning _want_ / _would like_. It is followed by a noun or a verb in the gerund, e.g. I **feel like pasta** for lunch today. (= I'd like pasta for lunch today). I **don't feel like going** to bed. (= I don't want to go to bed)

### _as_

_as_ is often used before _if_ to talk about how something appears, sounds, feels, etc.: It looks as if it's going to snow.
However, it is also used:
- to describe somebody or something's job or function: She works as a nurse. You can use that box as a chair.
- to compare people or things: She's as tall as me now.
- to give a reason: As it was raining, we didn't go out. (_as_ = _because_)
- to say that something happened while something was happening: As they were leaving, the postman arrived. (_as_ = _when_ / _at the same time_)
- after _such_ to give an example, e.g. I like soft fruits, such as strawberries and raspberries.
