### General idea

- Alain de Botton (_The School of Life_) says **there are six fundamental things a city needs to get right** to be attractive.
- “It’s not a mystery why we like some cities more than others.”

---

### 1. Order and variety

- People love **order** (e.g., Paris, New York) but too much is bad.
- Goal: **organized complexity**.
- Example: **Telc, Czech Republic** — houses differ in colour and detail, but same height and width.

---

### 2. Visible life

- Streets should be **full of people and activity** to be beautiful.
- Problem: modern cities have **characterless office blocks and industrial zones** with no street life.

---

### 3. Compactness

- Attractive cities are **compact, not sprawling**.
- Example: **Barcelona** vs **Phoenix, Arizona**.
- **Beautiful squares** are ideal meeting places; best if **not too large** so you can recognize faces across them.

---

### 4. Orientation and mystery

- Cities should mix **big boulevards for orientation** with **small streets** for wandering and **a sense of mystery**.
- Many cities **prioritize vehicles over humans**, which reduces walkability.

---

### 5. Scale

- Skylines now dominated by **tall banking/commercial buildings**.
- Ideal: **five stories** → dense, medium-rise cities (e.g., Berlin, Amsterdam).

---

### 6. Local colour

- **Sameness of cities** is a problem.
- Cities should show **local culture and history**.
- Build with **locally sourced materials** suited to **climate and traditions**.
