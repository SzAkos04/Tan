### General Idea

- **Silence is on the rise**: whole businesses **have sprung up to meet a rising demand in quiet time** now offering _silent weekends, silent dining, silent reading, even silent dating_.
- Normally, we share silence only with those closest to us → but now people **enjoy silence with strangers** → quite radical.

### Silent Reading

- Started in **Seattle (USA)** → spread to **UK (Dundee)**.
- **Format:** _"show up, shut up, and read"_ for 1–2 hours → then chat and drink.
- **Key expression:** _“There is something special about sharing silence with others.”_
- Offers escape from the **hubbub of everyday life**.

---

### Silent Dating (_Shhh!_)

- London group: silent **speed dating**.
- Idea: we are instinctively better at choosing the right partner when we _"see each other as we really are"_ without words.
- **Structure:**
    - Ice-breaking games
    - Pair up → gestures only
    - 60 seconds of uninterrupted eye contact
    - Exchange contact details if interested
- Second date: silent dinner or _"mute trip to the pictures"_.

### Silent Dinners (Honi Ryan)

- Started **10+ years ago**, hosted globally (Mexico, USA, Australia, Lebanon, China).
- **Rules:**
    - No talking, no reading/writing, no tech, stay at least 2 hours.
- **Key expression:** _“Silence strips away our rehearsed social behaviours.”_
- Shows that connections over food **don’t depend on words**.

---

### Silent Retreats

- Often **religious/spiritual**; last from a few days to weeks, usually remote.
- Example: **Peter Cadney** → joined 10-day silent meditation.
    - He was dealing with break-ups, death of a friend, stress & anxiety from computer work.
    - Found silence peaceful → noticed _“just how many thoughts were coming and going.”_
- Improved both mental and physical health

---

### Conclusion

- In today’s **social-media era**, we are “always talking” without opening our mouths.
- Silence is taking on a **new meaning**.
- Final question: _“Can we actually muster up the self-restraint to embrace silence and stillness?”_
