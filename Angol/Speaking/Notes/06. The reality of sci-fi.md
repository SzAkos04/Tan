# The reality of sci-fi

## Aliens That Look Like Us

- Many films show aliens that could **fit comfortably into our clothes**.
- At first this seems unlikely — evolutionary circumstances would be different on other planets.
- But some scientists argue our body shape is the **optimal design for an intelligent being**.
- **Perhaps there is no other choice** than for aliens to look human-like.

## Travelling Faster Than Light

- Einstein said nothing can move faster than light.
- Yet some physicists see it as **a real possibility**.
- A spaceship surrounded by an energy bubble **could in theory** contract space in front and expand it behind.
- This would allow it to move faster than light relative to space.

## Teleportation

- Quantum information has been transmitted 10 miles — but that’s **a long way from** teleporting people.
- Teleportation **faces extreme obstacles**.
- Current methods are **only speculative**.

## Invisibility Cloaks

- Harry Potter-style invisibility is **far-fetched**.
- Scientists say some anti-detection technologies **might be possible**.
- True invisibility is **quite a way off**, but partial cloaks (like camouflage) could work.

## Intelligent Machines

- Robots already do specific tasks better than humans.
- But even after 50–60 years of research, AI still lacks common sense.
- Teaching a game is **a lot easier than** teaching everyday reasoning.
- Machines will get smarter, but **it is questionable whether** they will ever feel or have free will.

## Instant Learning

- In _The Matrix_, knowledge is uploaded straight into the brain.
- **Emerging research** suggests that the speed at which we learn a skill can be technologically boosted
- Brain stimulation can improve performance of visual tasks, so it’s **not totally implausible**.
- But it **might take a couple of hundred years** before skills can be uploaded directly.
