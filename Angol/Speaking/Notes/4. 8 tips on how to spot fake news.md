### 1. Beware of stories that **don’t make sense**

- Fake news is often **highly improbable**.
- Example: During Hurricane Irma, viral story said it was a **Category Six hurricane that would ‘wipe cities off the map’** — but **Category Six hurricanes do not exist**.
- Moy: **Extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence** (e.g., “If Elvis is alive, ask for a song”).

### 2. Check the name of the site

- **Names of sites are often a hint** — some sound real but are fake.
- Example: **Denver Guardian** claimed about Hillary Clinton’s emails, but **no such paper exists**.
- Moy: Be careful with **websites you haven’t heard of**.

### 3. Beware faked website addresses

- Some **impersonate real outlets** with URLs that have slight differences.
- Example: Fake ABC News site used **ABC.com.co** instead of **abcnews.go.com**.

### 4. Check the date

- False stories may have **timelines that make no sense** or wrong dates.
- Example: Images said to be from 2016 Brussels attack were actually from **2011 Moscow Domodedovo Airport attack**.

### 5. Look for unusual spelling and mistakes

- Fake news often has **low quality** writing — **spelling errors, over-use of capital letters**.
- **Real news sources** use editors to remove such errors.

### 6. Look out for fake celebrity accounts

- Fake stories can spread after being shared by **impersonator accounts**.
- Example: Fake Warren Buffett tweets — handle read **WarrenBuffet** (one “t” missing) instead of Warren Buffett.

---

### 7. Google-search the images

- Fake sites use **unrelated or doctored photos**.
- **Google-search** to check accuracy and source.
- Hoaxers may use **disturbing imagery to hook readers** — **emotional content is more likely to go viral**.

---

### 8. Double check with a trusted source

- Fake news often appears **on just one site**.
- If unsure, **check against a reliable source**.
- Moy: “When it matters, double check — especially for health or life decisions. Always use a trustworthy source.”
