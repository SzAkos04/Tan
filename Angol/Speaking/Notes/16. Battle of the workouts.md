# Battle of the workouts

## Situation

- Deciding to get fit is easy.
- Choosing _how to go about it_ (weights, circuits, yoga, Pilates, spinning, step) is more difficult.
- Four key questions for each activity:
    1. How quickly will it make a difference?
    2. How many calories does it burn?
    3. Will it keep me motivated?
    4. What are the benefits?

## 1. **Weights vs Circuits**

### Weights

- Results: toned muscles after 1st session; significant changes in 3–4 weeks.
- Calories: 136–340/hour (depends on weight + recovery).
- Motivation: good if your goal is improved body tone.
- Benefits: strengthening muscles, improve bone density, speeds up the rate of calorie burning → quicker weight loss.

### Circuits

- Results: changes after 2 weeks (if 2×/week).
- Calories: 476/hour.
- Motivation: constantly changing content and order keeps boredom away.
- Benefits: address every element of fitness – aerobic, strength, balance, flexibility. New tools (skipping rope, weights) to ensure you are always developing new skills.

## 2. **Yoga vs Pilates**

### Yoga

- Results: after 8 weeks (3×/week).
- Calories: 102/hour (stretching); up to 245/hour (power yoga).
- Motivation: focus is _sense of unity of body + mind_, not personal targets. Sense of accomplishment as you master the poses. Many types to try.
- Benefits: +13% flexibility, more press-ups (+6), sit-ups (+14).

### Pilates

- Results: 5–6 weeks (3×/week).
- Calories: 170–237/hour.
- Motivation: once you see changes in the way you move and hold your body, it’s _hard to give up_.
- Benefits: improves posture, strengthens trunk (core muscles), widely used by dancers & top athletes.

## 3. **Spinning vs Step**

### Spinning

- Results: 2–3 weeks (2×/week).
- Calories: 408–646/hour.
- Motivation: adjustable workload, video rides prevent boredom.
- Benefits: unbelievably toned legs & buttocks, but biggest beneficiaries = heart & lungs.

### Step

- Results: 4 weeks (2×/week).
- Calories: 510–612/hour (depends on step height).
- Motivation: body changes noticeable fairly quickly, _there are only so many times you can step on to a platform before utter boredom takes hold_.
- Benefits: +3.3% increase in bone density (spine, hips, legs), aerobic benefits + muscle toning.
