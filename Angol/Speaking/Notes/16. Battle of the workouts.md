### Situation

- Deciding to get fit is easy.
- Choosing _how_ (weights, circuits, yoga, Pilates, spinning, step) is harder.
- Four key questions for each activity:
    1. How quickly will it make a difference?
    2. How many calories does it burn?
    3. Will it keep me motivated?
    4. What are the benefits?

## 1. **Weights vs Circuits**

### Weights

- Results: toned muscles after 1st session; big changes in 3–4 weeks.
- Calories: 136–340/hour (depends on weight + recovery).
- Motivation: good if you want body tone.
- Benefits: muscle strength, bone density, speeds up calorie burning → quicker weight loss.

**Expression:** _speed up the rate at which calories are burned_ = boost metabolism.

### Circuits

- Results: changes after 2 weeks (if 2×/week).
- Calories: 476/hour.
- Motivation: variety keeps boredom away.
- Benefits: trains _everything_ – aerobic, strength, balance, flexibility. New tools (skipping rope, weights) keep it fun.

**Expression:** _unlikely to get bored_ = always varied.

## 2. **Yoga vs Pilates**

### Yoga

- Results: noticeable after 8 weeks (3×/week).
- Calories: 102/hour (stretching); up to 245/hour (power yoga).
- Motivation: focus is _unity of body + mind_, not targets. Many types to try.
- Benefits: +13% flexibility, more push-ups/sit-ups.

**Expression:** _sense of unity between body and mind_.

### Pilates

- Results: 5–6 weeks (3×/week).
- Calories: 170–237/hour.
- Motivation: once you see changes in posture, it’s _hard to give up_.
- Benefits: improves posture, strengthens abdominals (core muscles), widely used by dancers/athletes.

**Expression:** _hard to give up_ = addictive once progress is visible.

## 3. **Spinning vs Step**

### Spinning

- Results: 2–3 weeks (2×/week).
- Calories: 408–646/hour.
- Motivation: adjustable workload, video rides prevent boredom.
- Benefits: strong legs + buttocks, but biggest win = heart & lungs.

**Expression:** _unbelievably toned lower body_.

### Step

- Results: 4 weeks (2×/week).
- Calories: 510–612/hour (depends on step height).
- Motivation: body changes noticeable, but boredom risk (repetition).
- Benefits: increases bone density (spine, hips, legs), aerobic + muscle toning.

**Expression:** _before utter boredom takes hold_ = eventually repetitive.
