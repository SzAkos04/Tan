## Part 1 – Cadbury Chocolate Testing

**Situation:** A plain grey cardboard box was **dished out** to each boy in their house.

**Contents of the box:**
- 12 chocolate bars, all **different shapes** and **different fillings**, numbers 1–12 **stamped on the chocolate underneath**.
- 11 were **new inventions**, 1 was a **control bar** (usually Coffee Cream).
- A **sheet of paper** with numbers 1–12, plus **two blank columns** for:
    - Score (0–10)
    - Comments

**Task:**
- "**All we were required to do in return of this splendid gift...**"
- Taste each bar **carefully**
- Give **marks**
- Write **intelligent comments** on why you liked/disliked it

**Purpose:**
- Cadbury used boys as **expert testers**
- Boys were aged 13–18 and familiar with all existing chocolate bars
- "All of us entered into this game **with great gusto**, sitting in our studies and **nibbling** each bar **with the air of connoisseurs**, ..."
- "Too subtle for the common palate"

## Part 2 – Imagination and Inspiration

**Reflection:**
- Realized chocolate companies **actually did possess inventing rooms**
- "**I used to picture**" a **laboratory with bubbling chocolate and fillings**, staff in white coats **tasting, mixing and concocting** their new inventions
- Fantasy: invent a **new chocolate** and present it to Mr. Cadbury
	- "I would come up with sth so **unbearably** delicious ..."
    - Mr. Cadbury tastes it
    - **Leaps up**, praises, says: “We’ll sell it by the million!”
    - Inventor gets **reward and recognition** ("Your salary is doubled")

**Impact on author:**
- Later led to **plot ideas** for _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_
