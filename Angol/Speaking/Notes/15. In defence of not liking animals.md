## Situation

- Household “infested – sorry, blessed – with cats”: six total.
- Dylan (old cat) died last year, leaving Floss (infirm, senile).
- Wife accepted a kitten → it gave birth to four kittens.
- “Cute as a kitten” = not arbitrary → they are _extraordinarily lovable_.

---

## Problems of cats

- House starting to **smell**.
- Cats wake you up at 6 a.m., sit on your head, drink water from your glass.
- If door closed → they **complain** until it’s opened.
- Lovability **offset** by their **extraordinary flair in the art of being annoying**.

**Expression:** _flair in the art of being annoying_ → a special talent for causing irritation.

---

## Attitude to pets

- Pet sceptic (lifelong).
- Dislike not only cats but **positively averse** to dogs.
- Dogs: needy, time-consuming, trip hazards, smelly, even biting.  
    **Expression:** _positively averse_ → strongly dislike.

## On “animal lovers”

- Some think non-animal-lovers are “barely human.”
- Author not apologetic: grew up without pets.
- Only had a stickleback (died in 6 hours) + tortoise (shell mysteriously empty one day).
- Believes: not caring for animals ≠ emotionally defective.
- **Better to invest in children’s cancer research than animal sanctuaries.**

---

## Humans vs animals

- Humans: difficult to love (complex, contrary, let you down).
- Animals: easy to love (simple).
- Children adore animals, but _highly partial_: they “ohh and aah” at lambs, then eat them with mint sauce.  
    **Expression:** _sentimentality rather than genuine love_ → shallow emotional reaction, not real deep affection.

---

## Conclusion

- Cynic or not → author admits kittens are “gorgeous balls of fluff.”
- Plan: give away 3, keep 1, Floss will die soon → left with 2 cats.
- “I can live with that… as long as no one asks me to clean out the litter tray.”
