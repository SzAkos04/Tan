## **Five Things Every Parent Should Know About How Children Learn Language**

---

### **1. It begins early**

- **Even before birth**, babies start hearing speech in the womb.
- They can **identify rhythm** and some features of a speaker’s voice.
- At birth:
    - Prefer **mother’s voice** to other female voices.
    - Prefer **parents’ language** over others.
    - Can tell **English and French** sentences sound different.

**Expression:** “Children don’t wait until they’re born to start learning language.”

### **2. It happens fast**

- **Age 2–6**: about **10 new words a day**.
- By age 6: around **14,000 words**.
- Later: up to **20 new words a day**.
- **Strategies children use:**
    1. **Object assumption** – new words refer to objects first, not colour, texture, or action.
        - Example: Dad points to a sheep and says _sheep_ → child thinks it’s the animal, not “white” or “woolly.”
    2. **Adult behaviour clues** – noticing adults look at what they talk about → easier to guess meaning.

**Expression:** “Noticing where adults look is like a shortcut to understanding words.”

### **3. No two children are the same**

- Some are early **word pronouncers** – by 18 months, can name people (_Daddy_, _Mummy_) and objects (_cat_, _car_), plus feelings or wants (_up_, _hot_, _hungry_).
- Others store **chunks of speech** – _whatsat_ (What’s that?), _dunno_ (I don’t know), _awgone_ (It’s all gone) – often unclear but functional.
- They might **not know the parts** of those chunks yet.

**Expression:** “Some start with clear single words, others with rough but useful phrases.”

### **4. Errors are good**

- Mistakes like _goed_ (went) or _eated_ (ate) mean they’re **learning grammar rules**.
- Example: adding _-ed_ for past tense – they apply it to all verbs at first.
- Takes **hundreds of exposures** to correct irregular forms.
- Errors **fade naturally** as they hear more correct examples.

**Expression:** “Mistakes aren’t failures – they’re signs of progress.”

### **5. It’s what you say**

- Children need **language about things they can see, feel, or just experienced**.
- This helps them figure out:
    - **Word meanings**
    - **Sentence structure** (subject, object)
    - **How to ask questions**
- **Practical tip:** Talk to them about what **matters to them** – they’ll learn the rest naturally.

**Expression:** “Talk about their world, and they’ll take care of the rest.”
