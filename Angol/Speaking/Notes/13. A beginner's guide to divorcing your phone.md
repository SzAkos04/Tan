# A beginner's guide to divorcing your phone

## General Idea

- First thing many people do in the morning: news, emails, social media.
- If imagining no phone feels uncomfortable → maybe time for a **digital detox**.
- Tanya Goodin (digital detox specialist) → created a 7-day program.
- Step 1: use a tracking app (measures screen time + number of pick-ups).

## Rules for Detox

a) Delete social media apps (only use on desktop).
b) Turn off all notifications.
c) Keep phone away in meetings, meals, get-togethers (e.g. pocket).
d) Keep it out of sight during commute.
e) No phone in bathroom.

## Daily Challenges

Day 1. Leave phone outside bedroom overnight; alarm clock / turn up the volume of alarm (all week).
Day 2. Put phone in a central place at home (don’t carry it).
Day 3. Remove work email from phone (notify everyone in advance).
Day 4. Go out without your phone (e.g. dinner, lunch, gym, etc.).
Day 5. Airplane mode as default (all day); turn off only when you need to use it.
Days 6–7. Full detox: phone off Friday 7.00 p.m. → Monday 8.00 a.m.

## Case Study: **Anisah Osman Britton**

- 24, founder of 23 Code Street (coding school for women).
- Lives on a boat with her dog.

**Before Detox:**

- Screen time: 3h50/day.
- 88 pick-ups/day.
- Main apps: WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, Twitter.
- Insomnia → often scrolled at 4 a.m.

**During Detox:**

- Replaced Instagram with reading → finished 2 books → **cringe** at wasted time.
- Without phone **to hand**, slept better.
- Day 3: felt left out of family WhatsApp.
- Day 4: **things take a turn for the worse** (got sick) → kept phone in bed, back to old habits.
- Weekend: told family/work “talk on Monday”. By Saturday → **had a meltdown** (dead and quiet, no music, no people).
- Sunday: neighbour brought chocolate → she almost cried. Went to supermarket to speak to someone. Called it “worst weekend of my life.”

**After Detox:**

- Couldn't cope with not being able to take photos.
- Positive: stopped **flicking through** social media in bed before getting up.
- Gained an extra hour each morning.
- Screen time reduced: 3h/day.
- Pick-ups: 70/day.

## Key Expressions (to use while speaking)

- **cringe** → feel embarrassed or awkward
- **to hand** → available, within reach
- **take a turn for the worse** → suddenly get worse
- **have a meltdown** → lose control emotionally
- **flicking through** → scrolling casually without focus
