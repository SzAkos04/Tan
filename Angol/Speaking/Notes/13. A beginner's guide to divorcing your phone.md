## General Idea

- First thing many people do in the morning: news, emails, social media.
- If imagining no phone feels uncomfortable → maybe time for a **digital detox**.
- Tanya Goodin (digital detox specialist) → created a 7-day program.
- Step 1: use a tracking app (measures screen time + number of pick-ups).

Day 2. Put phone in a central place at home (don’t carry it).
Day 3. Remove work email from phone (warn colleagues).

## Case Study: **Anisah Osman Britton**

- 24, founder of 23 Code Street (coding school).
- Lives on a boat with her dog.

**Before Detox:**

- Screen time: 3h50/day.
- 88 pick-ups/day.
- Main apps: WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, Twitter.
- Insomnia → often scrolled at 4 a.m.

**During Detox:**

- Replaced Instagram with reading → finished 2 books → **cringe** at wasted time.
- Without phone **to hand**, slept better.
- Felt left out of family WhatsApp.
- Day 4: sick → **things take a turn for the worse** → kept phone in bed, back to old habits.
- Weekend: told family/work “talk Monday”. By Saturday → **had a meltdown** (too quiet, no music, no people).
- Sunday: neighbour brought chocolate → she almost cried. Called it “worst weekend of my life.”

**After Detox:**

- New problem: couldn’t take photos.
- Positive: stopped **flicking through** social media in bed.
- Gained an extra hour each morning.
- Screen time reduced: 3h/day.
- Pick-ups: 70/day.

## Key Expressions (to use while speaking)

- **cringe** → feel embarrassed or awkward
- **to hand** → available, within reach
- **take a turn for the worse** → suddenly get worse
- **have a meltdown** → lose control emotionally
- **flicking through** → scrolling casually without focus
