# 10 small ways to lead an anti-capitalist life

## General Idea

- Recently, there was a **deluge of replies** when people were asked about everyday non-capitalist actions.
- One reader said: _“Doing this small thing makes me feel I’m doing something positive”_ → this really **gets to the heart of** the idea.

---

## 1. Freecycle

- When you’re **lumbered with something** you don’t want or don't need → pass it on via Freecycle/Freegle to someone for whom it might have a use.
- People give away anything: _beds, bikes, pianos, even a bag of opened toiletries_.

---

## 2. Leave Things for Neighbours

- In Berlin, Chris Everitt’s community leaves books, clothes, furniture, and **knick-knacks** in a little covered alleyway.
- Sth that no longer serves you in your life → within a few hours, it will be part of someone else's life.

## 3. Make Your Own Clothes

- Example: Clea Whitley (London).
- Doesn’t buy high-street clothes (even though she can afford it) → only buys fabric and clothing patterns → makes her own.
- Avoids _child labour, toxic chemicals, and animal cruelty_.

---

## 4. Forget the Gym

- A graduate once paid £25/month → gym full of _warm air **laced with** sweat_ and loud pop music promoting affluent lifestyle.
- Jogging in the park → enjoy nature, no mirrors to make yourself feel bad or **pump up your ego**.

---

## 5. Spreadable Butter

- "A small contribution, perhaps, but ingenious."
- Mix butter with oil (preferably not too strong a taste) → spreads easier, reduces butter use.
- Avoids plastic tubs and palm oil (→ habitat destruction for orangutans).

---

## 6. Stop Buying Cleaning Products

- One person had a **watershed moment**: replaced cleaning products with a homemade mix of _white vinegar (or bicarbonate of soda) + water (1:3)_.

---

## 7. Use the Library

- Kath (from Oxford): Search books on Amazon, read reviews → then borrow from library.

---

## 8. Get an Allotment

- Retired teacher: Keep fit by growing vegetables → give  excess produce away after harvesting
- Self-sufficient in summer (as far as vegetables are concerned).
- Potatoes, squash, onions last until March.

---

## 9. Don’t Drive

- Example: Sara Gaynor.
- Since 1988: decided never to join car culture after living in Copenhagen → no petrol, no pollution, no traffic jams.
- Cycles everywhere (work, shopping); kids grew up on bikes + public transport.

## 10. Mute the TV Adverts

- One reader’s **pearl of wisdom**: when adverts come on → mute them.
