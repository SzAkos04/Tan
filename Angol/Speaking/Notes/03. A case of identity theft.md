## How it started

- **I sighed when I glanced at the email on my phone** – it was from **Constance**, a stranger.
- She **was under the impression that we’d been in a relationship for several months**.
- **Over the past two years, my photos have been used to con 11 women on dating websites** (actual number may be higher).

## Constance’s story

- Met “**Martin Peterson**” on Elite Singles.
- He claimed he was **Danish and a widower**.
- Constance joined the site after **losing her husband three years earlier**.
- Martin seemed **kind and understanding**, **interested in everything about her**, texting every morning and calling every evening.
- His dating profile included several photos **of me** — one **with my sister, who he claimed was his dead wife**.

## Suspicious signs

- Hair **colour and style changed within hours**.
- Claimed he was **on a business trip**.
- Sent a **photo of me**:
    - **Sitting in a hotel garden having breakfast**, **curly grey hair in need of a trim**.
    - Later: **photo of me by a swimming pool**, **hair shorter and darker**.
- In reality: **photos taken years apart**, **‘harvested’ from my Facebook account**.
- Constance investigated:
    - Used a **‘reverse image search’ on Google**.
    - Found that **the pictures of the “Danish widower” were actually of me, a public speaker from Brighton**.

## Typical scam pattern

- Scammers **prey on** older women.
- Steps:
    1. **Gain their trust**.
    2. **Bombard them with attention**.
    3. Claim to be **travelling abroad for work**.
    4. Say they’re **involved in an accident**.
    5. **Ask for money** for treatment or flights.
- Example: I once posted a **photo of me with blood on my face** (minor scratch).
    - Scammer used it with a **photo of a smashed-up car**, claiming a **serious accident**.

## Outcome

- Constance did not **hand over** money.
- Other women have lost thousands.

## Lessons learned

- Now I’m **more conscious of what I post online**.
- I **used to share pictures of everything** — holidays, speeches, dog, parties.
- Now I’ve **changed my privacy settings on social media**.
- My account was **targeted** because I had **a range of photos that could build a whole life**.
- Expert: photos likely **sold on the black market as a bundle**.
- I now **encourage friends and family to be wary about what they post**.
- Sadly, **my identity is no longer my own**.
