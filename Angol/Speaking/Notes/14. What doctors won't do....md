# What doctors won't do...

## 1. Have a full health check

- Going to GP with symptoms = **diagnosis** (listen, examine, investigate, decide).
- Health check when feeling totally well = **screening**.
- Few screenings where **advantages outweigh disadvantages** → could lead to unnecessary tests/treatments.
- Anecdotes exist, but risky.

---

## 2. Go to the doctor with a long list of symptoms

- Patients think it helps, but **it makes the doctor’s heart sink**.
- Hard to deal with all at once.
- Suggests multiple problems → looks like hypochondria.

---

## 3. Sunbathe

- **People underestimate the risk**.
- Even if skin looks fine, sunbathing → hidden damage → cancer risk.
- Strongest risk if done in teens/20s.
- Now cancers appear in under-40s too.
- Go out in the sun, but never lie in it with the purpose of getting a tan

## 4. Take sleeping tablets

- Many take them for decades.
- Addictive, side effects: falls, confusion, daytime sleepiness.
- Hard to **wean themselves off** → need higher doses over time.

---

## 5. Follow a low-carb diet

- Short-term weight loss, but may kill long-term.
- Swedish study: 43,396 women, 15 years.
- Women who **stuck to** low-carb/high-protein had 62% higher risk of heart attack/stroke.
- Food should be enjoyment, not turned into medicine, “wrong medicine.”

---

## 6. Have cosmetic surgery

- Not about anaesthetic risk.
- Surgery should never **be undertaken** for “soft” reasons (non-medical).
- Risk: unpleasant infections.  

---

## 7. See a counsellor

- Counselling = entirely unregulated area.
- Anyone can claim to be a counsellor.
- **Quality varies hugely** → some patients “further psychologically damaged“ from poorly-qualified practitioners.

## Key Expressions to Use in Speaking

- **advantages outweigh disadvantages** → benefits are greater than risks
- **makes the doctor’s heart sink** → disappoint/worry immediately
- **underestimate the risk** → think danger is smaller than reality
- **wean off** → gradually stop using something addictive
- **stuck to** → kept doing something, followed strictly
- **be undertaken** → be done, carried out
- **varies hugely** → very different in quality or level
