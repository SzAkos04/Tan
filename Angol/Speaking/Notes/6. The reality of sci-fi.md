### Aliens that look like us

- Unlikely they’d fit in our clothes after millions of years evolving elsewhere.
- Similar evolution could lead to **two-legged, symmetrical, tool-using shape**.
- Some scientists: could be **optimal design for intelligence** → may look human.

### Travelling faster than light

- Einstein: nothing faster than light — but **space can expand/contract** faster.
- Idea: **energy bubble** contracts space in front, expands behind → apparent FTL travel.

### Teleportation

- Quantum info sent ~10 miles, but **not actual material/people**.
- Huge scientific obstacles; only speculative ideas for now.

---

### Invisibility cloaks

- Sci-fi full cloaks (Star Trek, Harry Potter) far-fetched.
- Progress in **partial cloaks / camouflage** (like _Predator_) may be achievable.

---

### Intelligent machines

- Good at factory work/calculations; bad at basic tasks (e.g., shoelace + conversation).
- Easy to train for **specific tasks**; hard to give **common sense**.
- May get highly intelligent machines soon, but human-like **feelings/free will** questionable.

### Instant learning

- _The Matrix_–style instant upload not yet possible.
- Research: brain stimulation → better visual task performance.
- Possible centuries-ahead: **implants/hardware** for broadband-speed learning.
